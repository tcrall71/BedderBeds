This Java project is a Minecraft Mod in progress.  It's purpose is to introduce a sleeping bag with some new functionality into Minecraft, as well as add colors to beds.  Documentation (called "Sleeping Bag" which was my original name for the mod) and a beta .jar are located in src/main, though they are currently for version 1.1 since this project is still in progress.  Version 2.1 will add color to the sleeping bags and to beds.
